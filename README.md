## Setting up

Firstly you need to configure .env file in source directory. You can see example in .env-sample.  
To run the app use make commands below:  
build-app : builds docker images and starts containers.  
up : starts containers.    
stop : stops containers.    
restart : restarts containers.    
poetry: does all poetry commands without needing to go to source dir
